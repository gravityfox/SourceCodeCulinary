Hello,

This is the place for finding the sourcecode for the JMCuisineMod!!!

You are allowed to look at the source and use bits and peices, but you MUST NOT copy every bit of it.

We have the right to not post all the source code, and if we choose to do that, to bad! 
(We dont plan on doing this a lot)

Thank You,
